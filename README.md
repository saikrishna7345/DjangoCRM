# This is a simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application built with Django.

# The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) customers.

# To use the application, you will need to create a Django project and then add this application (crmwebsite) to the project's INSTALLED_APPS setting.

# Once you have added the application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting, you can run the following command to create the database tables for the application:

# python manage.py makemigrations

# python manage.py migrate

# Once the database tables have been created, you can start the Django development server by running the following command:

# python manage.py runserver

# You can then access the application at http://localhost:8000/.

# To create a new customer, you can click on the "Add Customer" button.

# To view a customer, you can click on the "Customer ID" button in the "HOME Customer" table.

# To update a customer, you can click on the "Update Customer" button in Customer's view page.

# To delete a customer, you can click on the "Delete Customer" button in Customer's view page.
